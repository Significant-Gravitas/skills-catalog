# Connectors

## How tool references work

Plugin files use `~~category` as a placeholder for whatever tool the user connects in that category. For example, `~~project tracker` might mean Asana, Linear, Jira, or any other project tracker with an MCP server.

Plugins are **tool-agnostic** — they describe workflows in terms of categories (chat, project tracker, knowledge base, etc.) rather than specific products. The [upstream MCP configuration](https://github.com/anthropics/knowledge-work-plugins/blob/1c7187c4fc17feefa6cde39517f12dae1249e6c4/productivity/.mcp.json) pre-configures specific MCP servers, but any MCP server in that category works.
